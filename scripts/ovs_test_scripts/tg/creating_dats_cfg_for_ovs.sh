; This setting specifies the percentage of packets sent by the Tester that can
; be tolerated to be lost, instead of being properly forwarded by the SUT.
; Note: Although the % symbol must not be provided here, the supplied value is a

; lost out of 100,000 packets sent by the Tester to the SUT.
; Default value: 0.0
