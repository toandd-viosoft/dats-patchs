    """5-Tuple based lookup and decision

    This use-case encompasses many of the building blocks of more complex applications:
    load distribution, symmetric load distribution, routing, policing...
    A resource demanding and a general way to formulate these use-cases is in terms of a lookup based on a sufficiently long key extracted from the packet.
    Using this formulation prevents or minimizes exploiting the structure of the underlying data.
    The conventional 5-tuple is used in this test as it requires some extraction steps and allows defining enough distinct values to find the performance limits.
    The load balanced (uniformly) towards any number of output ports.
    The load is increased (adding more ports if needed) while packets are load balanced using a hash table of 8M entries.

    The number of packets per second that can be forwarded determines the KPI. The packet size is 64 bytes.
    In this test packets can be reordered.
